abstract="{I would first like to quote the publisher's description: ``In 2007
    Terry Tao began a mathematical blog to cover a variety of topics, ranging
    from his own research and other recent developments in mathematics, to
    lecture notes for his classes, to nontechnical puzzles and expository
    articles. The first two years of the blog have already been published by the
    American Mathematical Society (see [Structure and randomness. Pages from
    year one of a mathematical blog (2008; Zbl 05380664)], [Poincar\'e's
    legacies. Part I. Pages from year two of a mathematical blog (2009; Zbl
    1171.00003)] and [Poincar\'e's legacies. Part II. Pages from year two of a
    mathematical blog (2009; Zbl 1175.00010)], respectively). The posts from the
    third year are being published in two volumes. The present volume consists
    of a second course in real analysis, together with related material from the
    blog.
 
 The real analysis course assumes some familiarity with general
    measure theory, as well as fundamental notions from undergraduate analysis.
    The text then covers more advanced topics in measure theory, notably the
    Lebesgue-Radon-Nikod\'ym theorem and the Riesz representation theorem,
    topics in functional analysis, such as Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces, and
    the study of spaces of distributions and key function spaces, including
    Lebesgue's $L^p$ spaces and Sobolev spaces. There is also a discussion of
    the general theory of the Fourier transform.
 
 The second part of the book
    addresses a number of auxiliary topics, such as Zorn's lemma, the
    Carath\'eodory extension theorem, and the Banach-Tarski paradox. Tao also
    discusses the epsilon regularisation argument -- a fundamental trick from
    soft analysis, from which the book gets its title. Taken together, the book
    presents more than enough material for a second graduate course in real
    analysis.
 
 The second volume consists of technical and expository articles
    on a variety of topics and can be read independently (see [An Epsilon of
    Room, II. Pages from year three of a mathematical blo (2011; Zbl
    1218.00001)]).''
 
 Reviewer's additional comments: The book under review,
    in particular its large first part as described above, may also serve as a
    comprehensive source of references to post-graduates and experienced
    researchers. Most of the standard concepts of functional analysis (in the
    wider sense) and more can be found here together with some nonstandard (and
    tedious to quote) topics which nevertheless frequently occur in research
    articles. The reviewer himself cited in one of his recent articles from
    Tao's web blog because one result needed (from interpolation theory) was
    explained there in a really nice and basic way, so that it seemed more
    adequate to quote from an (at that stage) unpublished web blog rather than
    from a high-level monograph. Most gratefully, the publication of the
    monograph under review now gives everyone the opportunity to quote from an
    officially published source in which many useful things from different areas
    of real analysis are presented in a uniform and easily accessible way. The
    author provides proofs of the most essential results, whereas some classical
    consequences are given as excercises only; but Tao's preparatory work will
    surely guide the skilled reader successfully.}",
