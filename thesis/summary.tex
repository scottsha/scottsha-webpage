The curve complex of Harvey allows combinatorial representation of a surface
mapping class group by describing its action on simple closed curves.
Similar complexes of spheres, free factors, and free splittings allow
combinatorial representation of the automorphisms of a free group.
We consider a Birman exact sequence for combinatorial models of
mapping class groups and free group automorphisms.
We apply this and other extension techniques to compute the
automorphism groups of several simplicial complexes associated
with mapping class groups and automorphisms of free groups.
